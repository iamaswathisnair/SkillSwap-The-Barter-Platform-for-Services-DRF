# SkillSwap-The-Barter-Platform-for-Services-DRF
âš¡ A real-world backend platform where users exchange services instead of money. For example: You teach me Python, I help you build your portfolio site.

ðŸ§  Why Itâ€™s Unique?

Itâ€™s not a marketplace like Fiverr or Upwork (no money involved).

Itâ€™s pure service exchange. 

Real-life barter system reimagined.

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Problem It Solves

People have skills but no money. Many students, freelancers, or professionals want help without paying â€” so they can exchange services (e.g., logo design for resume writing).

ðŸŽˆThe main highlights are :

Auth + Permissions

Offer matching logic

Task tracking & feedback system

Custom DRF logic

Advanced filtering + model relationships
