# Because in your project (ZeroLeak), different users do different jobs:

# Role	        What They Do
# employee	    Bound by NDA, could leak stuff (üòà maybe)
# company_owner	Can upload NDAs, track cases
# legal_team	Confirms if something is really a breach, closes legal cases
# investigator	Investigates reports, flags suspicious employees

# Role	Permissions
# üßë‚Äçüíº CompanyOwner	Upload NDAs, add employees
# üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è LegalTeam	View reports, resolve cases
# üïµÔ∏è Investigator	Flag employees, link leaks
# üë®‚Äçüíª Employee	View assigned NDAs
