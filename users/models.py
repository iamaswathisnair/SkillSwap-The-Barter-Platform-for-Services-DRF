# 💡 Why did you use this CustomUser?
# Because in your project (ZeroLeak), different users do different jobs:

# Role	        What They Do
# employee	    Bound by NDA, could leak stuff (😈 maybe)
# company_owner	Can upload NDAs, track cases
# legal_team	Confirms if something is really a breach, closes legal cases
# investigator	Investigates reports, flags suspicious employees

# Role	Permissions
# 🧑‍💼 CompanyOwner	Upload NDAs, add employees
# 👨‍⚖️ LegalTeam	View reports, resolve cases
# 🕵️ Investigator	Flag employees, link leaks
# 👨‍💻 Employee	View assigned NDAs
